              <h3>What is StartOps?</h3>
              <p>StartOps is a community for supply chain and logistics professionals
              at the top D2C ecommerce companies. Our mission is to be the first
              place you turn to when you need help solving a problem — for
              vendor reviews, informative content, and connections with other experts
              on the network.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Does StartOps cost anything to join?</h3>
              <p>No.  StartOps is free for members. In the future, paid services may
                be available through the platform.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Who can join StartOps?</h3>
              <p>StartOps is open to those with logistics and supply chain
                expertise at top D2C ecommerce startups. If you have questions
                about eligibility, please email
                <a href="mailto:admin@startops.network">admin@startops.network</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Are vendors allowed on StartOps?</h3>
              <p>Definitely not at this point. Members may not use StartOps to
                solicit business, either for themselves or on behalf of others.
                Members may not be in a sales or BD role at any company that
                commercially pursues D2C ecommerce companies.
                Failure to disclose commercial interests may result in the
                offending member to be banned permanently from the platform.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>What is required of members?</h3>
              <p>StartOps can only succeed if all members are committed to
                contributing their expertise. For the beginning portion of your
                membership, you will receive a weekly survey via email. This
                will help us take a detailed “inventory” of your skills and
                experiences. We’ve tried to make these surveys quick and
                painless. From time to time, you may also be asked or required
                to complete other tasks in order to retain membership. That said
                 — we know you’re incredibly busy, and we don’t take your time
                 for granted. When we do have asks for you, we’ll ensure they
                 are high-value, easy to complete, and don’t take too long.</p>

              <h3>I want to write for the StartOps blog. How do I do that?</h3>
              <p>Just drop us a line at
                <a href="mailto:admin@startops.network">admin@startops.network</a>
                with a pitch for your idea! We’ll make sure your chosen topic is
                 a good fit for the blog. If it is, you can either submit an
                 article yourself, or you can craft an outline and we can have
                 our team write it for you.</p>

              <h3>Is it possible to get kicked off the platform?</h3>
              <p>Yes. The easiest way to get kicked off is by being offensive to
                 other members. StartOps maintains a zero tolerance policy
                 towards hateful or profane language or actions on the platform.
                 You can also get removed for violating our policy against
                 soliciting business on the platform. Finally, StartOps reserves
                 the right to remove anyone from the network at any time,
                 without need for cause.</p>
